# Project: Web Prototype Mockup

## Design System
- Use a consistent color palette with primary colors: #4A90E2 (blue), #50E3C2 (teal), #F5A623 (orange)
- Secondary colors: #9013FE (purple), #D0021B (red), #7ED321 (green)
- Neutral colors: #F8F8F8 (light gray), #4A4A4A (dark gray), #9B9B9B (medium gray)
- Typography: Primary font is 'FIra Sans', fallback to system sans-serif
- Font sizes: Headings 24-32px, Body text 16px, Small text 14px
- Spacing system uses multiples of 8px (8px, 16px, 24px, 32px, etc.)
- Border-radius: 4px for small elements, 8px for cards, 16px for modals
- Shadows: Light (0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)), Medium (0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)), Heavy (0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.1))

## Component Guidelines
- Buttons: Primary (filled blue), Secondary (outlined), Tertiary (text only)
- Cards: White background, light shadow, 16px padding, 8px border radius
- Forms: Labels above inputs, 8px spacing between label and input
- Navigation: Sticky header with logo and main nav items
- Modals: Centered, white background, 24px padding, close button in top right

## Code Standards
- Use vanilla HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript
- Create reusable components through HTML templates or JS functions
- Leverage third-party libraries when helpful (CDN preferred)
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Semantic HTML5 elements
- Accessibility standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- CSS custom properties for theming

## Approved Third-Party Libraries
- CSS: Bootstrap, Tailwind (via CDN), or Bulma for UI components
- JS: Alpine.js for lightweight interactivity
- Icons: Font Awesome or Google Material Icons
- Utilities: lodash for helper functions
- Animation: Animate.css for simple animations
- Forms: FormValidation.io for input validation
- HTTP: Axios or Fetch API for API calls

## Component Reuse Strategy
- Create a /components folder with HTML snippets for common elements
- Use JavaScript templates or HTML imports to reuse components
- Document components with example usage in comments
- For repeated UI elements, create helper functions to generate HTML

## Responsive Breakpoints
- Mobile: 0-639px
- Tablet: 640px-1023px 
- Desktop: 1024px+

## Project Structure
- index.html: Main entry point
- /css: Stylesheets (styles.css, normalize.css)
- /js: JavaScript files and components
- /components: Reusable HTML/JS components
- /images: Image assets
- /pages: Additional HTML pages (if needed)
- /vendor: Third-party libraries (if not using CDN)

## Prototype Goals
- Focus on visual fidelity and user experience
- Reuse components for consistency and efficiency
- Leverage third-party libraries to accelerate development
- Ensure responsive design works on all screen sizes
- Balance simplicity with maintainability
